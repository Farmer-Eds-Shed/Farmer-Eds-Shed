# 👨‍🌾 Farmer Ed’s Shed

Welcome to my shed — where open-source meets farmyard pragmatism.

I’m a software developer, electronic engineer, and farmer with a passion for solving data interoperability challenges on farms. In my day job, I work on integrating milking systems, weighing scales, EID readers, and more. I focus on bridging the gaps between agri-tech, environmental sensing, and automation. This repo contains my personal projects — everything from farm tools to home automation, with a special focus on health monitoring, which is important to me due to my daughter having epilepsy.

Most repos are works-in-progress — feedback, forks, and ideas welcome!
